# Wordle_guesser

## Aim of the project
The purpose of this project is to implement the 3Blue1Brown Wordle guesser (https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA?si=_RIAwOU6XqhRInt7). Starting from the best initial guess, the code returns the word that maximizes entropy. We consider all acceptable Wordle words, even though the solutions are drawn from a smaller list not provided here. In words.csv, all the possible words are given. The code is provided in Wordle.ipynb.
